BASIC FANTASY ROLE-PLAYING GAME
PRODUCT IDENTITY LICENSE
Subject to the terms of the Open Game License, above, you
may create derivative works based upon the Basic Fantasy
RPG core rules (this document). However, the Open Game
License protects the Product Identity (explained and
detailed above) such that you must have permission from
the copyright holder before you may use any of the listed
Product Identity.
You may use certain items of the listed Product Identity
under the following conditions:
1. You must comply fully with the Open Game License,
version 1.0a, as described above; and
2. The work may not be obscene in nature; in general, any
work containing subject matter that would qualify for an NC17
movie rating in the United States, or an R rating due to
explicit sexual content, is considered obscene for purposes
of this license.
If you comply with the above conditions, you may do either
or both of the following:
1. Include the text “Designed for use with the Basic Fantasy
Role-Playing Game” or “Designed for use with the Basic
Fantasy RPG”;
2. Use one or more of the official logos provided on the
Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game website:
http://basicfantasy.org/logo.html
A logo may be resized as needed, but must not be distorted
and may not be altered other than to resize it, except as
specifically provided on that page.
If you wish to use other Product Identity from this work, you
must request and receive explicit permission from the
copyright holder.
In any of the above cases where the Basic Fantasy RolePlaying
Game Product Identity is used in your work, you must
also include the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game website
address “basicfantasy.org” or "www.basicfantasy.org" in that
work. You may place the website address adjacent to the
logo and/or name, or you may include it on your title page,
or place it in some other location where any reasonably
observant person would expect to find it.
You may not under any circumstances describe your work
as actually being the "Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game" or
some derivative thereof, nor may you identify it as being in
any way an "official" publication of the Basic Fantasy Project
without the express permission of the author of this work.
